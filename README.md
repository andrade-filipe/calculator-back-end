<p>This repository is the back-end for my Calculator project, the front-end is found at: https://github.com/andrade-filipe/calculator-app</p>
<p>made with Java and Spring, it's a simple API.</p>
<p>The goal is process correctly all mathematical expressions the user sends from the front-end</p>

<p>ExpressionInput Class: Controls how the Expression is inputted into the API ✔️</p>
<ul>
<li>CalculatorController: Manage all requests made to the API ✔️</li>
    <ul>
        <li>getExpression(): Returns the current value of the expression ✔️</li>
        <li>solve(): Returns the solved expression ✔️</li>
        <li>clear(): Returns the expression cleared ✔️</li>
        <li>buildExpression(): Process the inputs from the user ✔️</li>
